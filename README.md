# STA 138 Analysis of Cateogorical Data

## Final Project

This project uses the dataset Byssinosis.csv.

### Project Instructions

In 1973, a large cotton textile company in North Carolina participated in a study to investigate the prevalence of byssinosis, a form of pneumoconiosis to which workers exposed to cotton dust are subject. Data was collected on 5,419 workers, including:

	* Type of work place [1 (most dusty), 2 (less dusty), 3 (least dusty)]

	* Employment, years [< 10, 10–19, 20–]

	* Smoking [Smoker, or not in last 5 years]

	* Sex [Male, Female]

	* Race [White, Other]

	* Byssinosis [Yes, No]

Your task is to investigate relationships between this disease on the one hand and smoking status, sex, race, length of
employment, smoking, and dustiness of workplace on the other. To do so, select, fit, and then interpret an appropriate
statistical model. Can you conclude in particular that workplace dustiness contributes to the chance of byssinosis? You
will be graded on succinctly using valid statistical tools to uncover meaningful associations in the data and convincingly
communicating them.
